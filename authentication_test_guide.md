## Browser Console Logs

During testing, check browser console (F12) for these logs:

### **Registration Logs**:
```
Firebase configuration contains demo/placeholder values
Using local authentication due to demo configuration
Local user registered successfully: test@example.com
```

### **Sign-In Logs**:
```
Found user for email: test@example.com
Local user signed in successfully: test@example.com
```

### **Sign-Out Logs**:
```
Starting sign out process...
Cleared current_user from local storage
Cleared stored credentials
Cleared password hashes
Sign out completed successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

### **If Registration Fails**:
- Check console for specific error messages
- Ensure all fields are filled correctly
- Try different email address
- Clear browser data and try again

### **If Sign-In Fails**:
- Verify you're using the same email/password from registration
- Check console for authentication errors
- Try registering a new account

### **If Sign-Out Doesn't Work**:
- Check console for error messages
- Try refreshing the page and signing out again
- Verify you're clicking the correct sign-out button in Settings

### **If Stuck on Loading**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Refresh the page
- Clear browser cache and cookies

## Expected User Experience

### **Good UX Indicators**:
- ✅ Clear error messages for validation failures
- ✅ Success messages for completed actions
- ✅ Smooth transitions between screens
- ✅ No manual sign-in required after registration
- ✅ Proper redirection after sign-out

### **Performance Expectations**:
- Registration: < 2 seconds
- Sign-in: < 1 second
- Sign-out: < 1 second
- Page transitions: Immediate

## Security Verification

### **Data Storage**:
- User data stored locally in browser (Hive)
- Passwords are hashed for security
- Credentials cleared on sign-out

### **Session Management**:
- Authentication state persists across browser refresh
- Sign-out completely clears session
- No access to protected routes when signed out

The authentication system should now work smoothly with proper user feedback and state management!
